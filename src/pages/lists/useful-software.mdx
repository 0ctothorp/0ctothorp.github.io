# Useful software

This is a list of software I use,

or I don't, but is interesting enough for me to store on this list ðŸ˜‰

I tend to forget names of apps that I use. Sometimes, because I use them rarely and sometimes, because I have an ocassional brain fog.
This list was created, so I can have an easily accessible place where all my favorite apps are listed and also some random people on the internet can benefit from it.
